                Hagia Sophia
                The Hagia Sophia was a former Eastern Orthodox cathedral before it was converted into a mosque by Mehmed
                the Conqueror, and then to a religious museum in 1935, located in Istanbul, Turkey. It is one of the
                most prominent examples of Byzantine architecture and Ottoman decoration.
                Emperor Justinian began to build this church in 532 AD, and it took about five years to build it
                officially opened in 537 AD, and Justinian did not want to build a church in the fashionable style of
                his time, but always tended to new innovation. He commissioned the architects Isodore al-Melisi and
                Anthemius Tralini to build this monumental religious edifice.
                The attention was directed towards the beautification of the building and a large ornamentation from the
                inside. Justinian used to gather the possibilities of the empire to decorate and decorate the building.
                Of the plaster and painted above geometric decorations and Arabic calligraphy, but many of these layers
                fell and the ancient scenes appeared below.

                Taj Mahal:
                It is a magnificent mausoleum, an elegant white marble architecture found in a hill in the strings of
                Brads in India. It was built by King Shah Jahan of the Mughal Emperor (1630 - 1648) to include the
                remains of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the third wife known as Mumtaz Mahal. The word Taj Mahal is distorted
                from the princess's name, Mumtaz Mahal. His design was developed by the well-known engineer Issa Shirazi
                and Amanullah Khan Shirazi. The white alabaster from Jidhabur was built on a terrace covered with white
                alabaster, and at each corner of the terrace was a harmonious minaret with a height of 37 m. The circles
                are surrounded by three balconies, and in the center of the terrace, the mausoleum rises in the form of
                a quadrant. Its height is 22.5 m. Each of the four facades of the building has a high entrance, covered
                by a knot, beneath the large dome above the center of the building, the mausoleum of the princess, and
                next to her husband's mausoleum, both decorated with inscriptions. One of the most beautiful models of
                Islamic architecture, it is widely known as "the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the world's
                timeless masterpieces".
                The Taj Mahal is considered by many of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, a style that combines
                Persian, Turkish, Ottoman and Indian architectural styles.

                    The most famous of the seven Emirates in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Dubai is a world-class destination.
                    The story of ‘modern’ Dubai is relatively short. The Emirate has been established for thousands of years, yet within the last few decades, Dubai has transformed itself into the ambitious, dynamic Emirate we experience today.
                    In 1894, the introduction of full tax exemption invited traders around the world to take advantage of the Emirate’s unique benefits. In the 1940’s and 50’s, Dubai prospered in the gold trade, providing a strong economy for its 40,000 population. This was just the start as the mid 1960’s unveiled the discovery of oil and Dubai’s economy went into overdrive, leading to an influx of foreign workers.
                    In 1973, Dubai joined the other Emirates to adopt a single, uniform currency: the UAE dirham. In the late 70s, the Jebel Ali Free Zone was created, comprising the world’s largest port and providing foreign countries and businesses unrestricted import and export.
                    As oil prices increased, Dubai focused closely on developing free-trade and tourism. In 2000, the Dubai Financial Market was established and by 2006 had made a net profit of approx AED 797.5 million. The Emirate also invested into developing the Jebel Ali Free Zone, which soon became a success and contributed 26% towards Dubai’s total GDP in 2007.
                    In addition to Jebel Ali, Dubai Internet City and Media City were two of the original free-zones, offering foreign companies the tax free commercial space so highly sought after. With thousands of companies moving offices to Dubai, the demand for residential real estate was unprecedented. The world’s eyes turned on Dubai, with investors looking to invest in Dubai property before construction even began.
                    In 2002, The Crown Prince of Dubai made a commitment to allow foreign nationals to own a property freehold within the Emirate. This was followed in 2006 with the publication of the lands law allowing foreign nationals the right to register their freehold property.
                    Despite the recent global economic conditions, Dubai retains the fundamentals which excelled it to become an investors dream, a place like no other and one of the most thriving destinations for real estate in the world. While there has been an adjustment in demand, the market is now returning and prices have bottomed out. Now, some of the best property deals ever witnessed are available on the market. Some desirable areas such as Dubai Marina have in fact experienced a rise in rental prices.

                    To know Malaysia is to love Malaysia - a bubbling, bustling melting-pot of races and religions where Malays, Indians, Chinese and many other ethnic groups live together in peace and harmony. Our multiculturalism has made Malaysia a gastronomical paradise and home to hundreds of colourful festivals. It's no wonder that we love celebrating and socialising. As a people, Malaysians are very relaxed, warm and friendly.
                    Geographically, Malaysia is almost as diverse as its culture. 11 states and 2 federal territories (Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya) form Peninsular Malaysia which is separated by the South China Sea from East Malaysia which includes the 2 states (Sabah and Sarawak on the island of Borneo) and a third federal territory, the island of Labuan.
                    One of Malaysia's key attractions is its extreme contrasts which further add to this theme of ‘diversity’. Towering skyscrapers look down upon wooden houses built on stilts while five-star hotels sit just metres away from ancient reefs.
                    Rugged mountains reach dramatically for the sky while their rainforest-clad slopes sweep down to floodplains teeming with forest life. Cool highland hideaways roll down to warm, sandy beaches and rich, humid mangroves.
                    For the perfect holiday full of surprises, the time is now, the place is Malaysia.

                    The main attractions of Norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the Arctic Circle. It is famous for its fjord-indented coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. Popular tourist destinations in Norway include Oslo, Ålesund, Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim and Tromsø. Much of the nature of Norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. The fjords, mountains and waterfalls in Western and Northern Norway attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. In the cities, cultural idiosyncrasies such as the Holmenkollen ski jump attract many visitors, as well as science abilities and cultural learnings and things such as Bryggen in Bergen and the Vigeland Sculpture Park in Oslo, and they do not know about it.
